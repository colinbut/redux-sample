# Redux Sample

Redux is an alternative to Flux. Very similar to Flux.

#### What is Flux?

Flux can be considered an architectural pattern just like MVC is. People argue that Flux is just MVC being squashed and brings
the concept of using an event-driven approach to implement MVC.

Flux was came up by Facebook.

#### Integration with React

Redux works well with React.

It is much simpler version than Flux.

Some people consider Redux to be a specific implementation of the Flux architectural pattern.

It is so simple such that you have:

1. Actions
2. Reducers
3. Store

mainly these 3 things.

No need for a Dispatcher and/or Event Emitters. Still has Action Creators though.

Write code in ES6.

#### Redux principles
 - Single Source of Truth
 - Read-Only State
 - Promotes uni-directional data flow
